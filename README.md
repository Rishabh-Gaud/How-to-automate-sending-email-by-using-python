# How-to-automate-sending-email-by-using-python
create html email message 

there is only one file name is "automate.py"



this is a file where you just write your email, password, and users email ID's which you want to send  Designer email message by  only one click. 



If you decide to use a Gmail account to send your emails, I highly recommend setting up a throwaway account for the development of your code. This is because you’ll have to adjust your Gmail account’s security settings to allow access from your Python code, and because there’s a chance you might accidentally expose your login details. Also, I found that the inbox of my testing account rapidly filled up with test emails, which is reason enough to set up a new Gmail account for development.

A nice feature of Gmail is that you can use the + sign to add any modifiers to your email address, right before the @ sign. For example, mail sent to my+person1@gmail.com and my+person2@gmail.com will both arrive at my@gmail.com. When testing email functionality, you can use this to emulate multiple addresses that all point to the same inbox.

# To set up a Gmail address for testing your code, do the following:


1. Create a new Google account.
2. Turn Allow less secure apps to ON. Be aware that this makes it easier for others to gain access to your account.

# now open this automate.py file in our local enviornment and  fil basic detail and run the file on terminal. Congrats you are able to automate email by using python. :)
